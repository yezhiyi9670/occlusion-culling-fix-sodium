This is a mod which "fixes" MC-70850 for MC1.18+ by ~~disabling Occlusion Culling~~ properly fixing it.

It should have been already fixed since it is resolved by Mojang in 1.17. However, [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)/[Rubidium]() brought it back so we need to fix it again.

‚ö†Ô∏è Keep in mind that the fix is somehow breaking and will impact FPS. If you encounter performance issues, try removing this fix mod before blaming Sodium.

Effect

![](logo-standard.png)

The chunk with letters "VISIBLE" in it was hidden in vanilla because of [MC-70850](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-70850). Mojang fixed that in 1.17, Sodium brought it back, and this mod fixed that again. You can get the test save for the bug on Mojira.

Side Effects
-----

Though being an almost-proper fix, this fix does not completely match the intention of the original code. This might result in minor performance loss. However, we did not find significant performance drops.

This fixes MC-70850 only. Another issue, [MC-63020](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-63020) causes a similar issue, and was fixed in 1.16.
